It has no\n connection to any of the DC films that have come before it.\n\n We see it as a classic Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate\n and oddly funny, the characters live in the real world and\n the stakes are personal.\n\n Although it is never mentioned in the film, this story takes\n place in the past.\n\n Let's call it 1981\\.\n\n It's a troubled time. The crime rate in Gotham is at record\n highs. A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past\n six weeks. And the divide between the \"haves\" and the \"have\\-\n nots\" is palpable. Dreams are beyond reach, slipping into\n delusions.\n\n\n\n OVER BLACK:\n HEAR LAUGHTER.\n The sound of a man totally cracking up.\n\n FADE IN:\n1 INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE \\- MORNING 1\n CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so\n hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black\n hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded\n zip\\-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years\n of use, hangs loosely around his neck.\n\n WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his\n mouth. Almost forming a smile.\n\n He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),\n African American. Her office is cramped and run\\-down in a\n cramped and run\\-down building. Stacks of folders piled high\n in front of her.\n\n She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit\n to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.\n\n Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.\n\n Beat.\n\n JOKER \\-\\-is it just me, or is it getting\n crazier out there?\n\n Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.\n Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER It's certainly tense. People are\n upset, they're struggling. Looking\n for work. The garbage strike seems\n like it's been going on forever.\n These are tough times.\n (then)\n How 'bout you. How's the job? Still\n enjoying it?\n\n JOKER Yeah, I mean, it's different each\n day, so I really like that. I don't\n think I could ever work in an\n office. Behind a desk.\n (MORE) 2\\.\n JOKER (CONT'D) (beat)\n No offense.\n\nShe smiles. Writes something down. Looks at the clock, she's\nrunning late for her next appointment.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER Have you been keeping up with your\n journal?\n\n JOKER Everyday.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER Great. Did you bring it with you?\n\nBeat.\n\n JOKER (dodging the subject)\n I'm sorry. Did I bring what?\n\n SOCIAL WORKER (impatient; she doesn't\n have time for this)\n Arthur, last time I asked you to\n bring your journal with you. For\n these appointments. Do you have it?\n\n JOKER Yes ma'am.\n\nBeat.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER Can I see it?\n\nHe reluctantly reaches into his bag. Pulls out a weathered\nnotebook. Slides it across to her\\-\\-\n\n JOKER I've been using it as a journal,\n but also a joke diary. Funny\n thoughts or, or observations\\-\\- Did\n I tell you I'm pursuing a career in\n stand\\-up comedy?\n\nShe's half\\-listening as she flips through his journal.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER No. You didn't.\n\n JOKER I think I did.\n 3\\.\n\nShe doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal\\-\\-\n\n SOCIAL WORKER Oh yeah. Because of what your\n mother said,\\-\\- about your purpose.\n \"To bring laughter and joy to the\n world,\" right?\n\n JOKER Right.\n\nANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes, all in neat,\nangry\\-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcore\npornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings.\n\nA flash of anger crosses Joker's face. We see him picking at\nhis right eyebrow, almost obsessively. Trying to stay calm.\nHis eyebrow is actually half\\-gone. Something he does a lot.\n\n JOKER I didn't realize you wanted to read\n it.\n\nThe social worker gives him a look, then reads something in\nthe pages that gives her pause.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER (reading out loud)\n \"I just hope my death makes more\n sense than my life.\"\n\nShe looks up at Joker. He just stares back. Lets it hang out\nthere for a beat.\n\nThen he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's\nfunny\\-\\-\n\n JOKER Yeah. I mean, that's just\\-\\-\n\n SOCIAL WORKER Does my reading it upset you?\n\nHe leans in.\n\n JOKER No. I just,\\-\\- some of it's\n personal. You know?\n\n SOCIAL WORKER I understand. I just want to make\n sure you're keeping up with it.\n\nShe slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.\n 4\\.\n SOCIAL WORKER What about your mom? How's she\n feeling?\n\n JOKER She has good days. But mostly bad.\n It's been a big help having me\n there. She really needs me.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER Seems like she's been sick a lot\n since you got home.\n\n JOKER (nods)\n Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I\n was in the hospital, after my last\n episode\\-\\- she was having trouble\n getting over there to visit.\n\nShe looks back up at the clock, she needs to get to her next\nappointment.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER All right. So, I'll see you again,\n two weeks from today?\n\nHe nods. But keeps sitting there for a moment.\n\nShe stands up, trying to signal it's time for him to leave\\-\\-\n\n SOCIAL WORKER Is there something else I can help\n you with, Arthur? My next\n appointment is waiting.\n\nHe just keeps sitting there.\n\n JOKER Yeah, I was wondering if you could\n ask the doctor to increase the\n dosage on my medications? Nothing\n seems to make a difference.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER (looking over his record)\n Do you know which ones you'd like\n increased?\n\nShakes his head, no.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER Have you been sleeping?\n 5\\.\n JOKER (lying)\n Some.\n\n She glances at his file again.\n\n SOCIAL WORKER Arthur, you're on seven different\n medications. Surely they must be\n doing something.\n\n He finally stands up. Zips up his faded red sweatshirt.\n\n Looks at her\\-\\-\n\n JOKER I just don't wanna feel so bad\n anymore.\n\n CUT TO BLACK:\n TITLE:\n JOKER\n2 EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE, MIDTOWN \\- KENNY'S MUSIC SHOP \\- DAY 2\n GOTHAM SQUARE IS CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC. Non\\-stop honking\n horns, pedestrians crowding the sidewalk. Huge billboards,\n giant movie marquees, garbage bags piled high everywhere.\n Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something\n bouncy and fast\\-paced.\n\n FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET, we see Joker. He's dressed\n as a sad\\-faced HOBO CLOWN. This is his job.\n\n Dressed in tattered clothes, dark five o'clock shadow painted\n on his face, big bulbous red nose, his mouth's outlined in\n white, turned down at the corners.\n\n He's holding up a sign in front of Kenny's Music Shop that\n reads, \"EVERYTHING MUST GO!\" A banner above the store reads,\n \"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!\" Behind him, an OLD MAN plays a piano\n on the street. Both of them there to draw attention to the\n big sale going on in the store.\n\n Joker's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the\n music. Most people walk right past, ignoring him. A few bump\n into him by mistake.\n\n JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS, no more than 15\\-years\\-old,\n walking toward him. He moves out of their way. They crack up\n laughing when they see him. Start making fun of him.\n 6\\.\n\n Joker ignores them, tries to do his job the best he can while\n maintaining some dignity. Keeps dancing and holding up the\n sign.\n\n One of the kids knocks the sign out of Joker's hands\\-\\-\n\n KID \\#1 Suck my dick, clown.\n\n The kids laugh. Joker doesn't say anything. Just bends over\n to pick up the sign\\-\\-\n\n Another kid kicks him in the ass\\-\\-\n\n KID \\#2 Whoops.\n\n Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man\n playing the piano picks up the pace of the music\\-\\-\n\n The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Joker's sign and\n takes off running across the street\\-\\-\n\n The other kids follow, weaving through traffic\\-\\-\n\n Joker gets up and gives chase. He needs his sign back.\n\n He almost gets hit by a taxi, spinning out of the way just in\n time\\-\\- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short\n of hitting him.\n\n Joker keeps running through traffic. People stare. A clown\n barreling down the street has got to be a joke\\-\\-\n\n\n3 EXT. CORNER, SIDE STREET \\- GOTHAM SQUARE \\- CONTINUOUS 3\n The five boys are booking it down the crowded street laughing\n and whooping it up. At the last second they take a sharp\n right turn down a cross street\\-\\-\n\n Joker almost overshoots the corner, slip\\-sliding in his big\n red shoes\\-\\-\n\n He rights himself and heads down after them\\-\\-\n\n Sees them running up ahead\\-\\-\n\n WHAP! Out of nowhere Joker gets hit in the face!\n\n He falls to the ground.\n\n One of the kids was hiding between parked cars and hit Joker\n with the \"EVERYTHING MUST GO!\" sign, splintering it in two\\-\\-\n 7\\.\n\n The other kids turn back and walk up to Joker down on the\n ground.\n\n Joker reaches out, still trying to save the sign\\-\\-\n\n THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Joker.\n It's brutal and vicious. Nobody on the street stops to help.\n\n CLOSE ON JOKER'S HOBO CLOWN FACE, down on the ground. Sweat\n running down his face, smearing his make\\-up. He doesn't even\n look like he's in pain. He just takes the beating.\n\n That stupid frown painted on his face.\n\n\n4 INT. CITY BUS (PULLING OUT) \\- HEADING DOWNTOWN \\- DUSK 4\n Joker, makes his way toward the back of the crowded bus, now\n walking with a slight limp, but keeping his head held high.\n\n His make\\-up's washed off, costume and props all shoved into a\n big shopping bag slung over his shoulder. Some white grease\\-\n paint still smudged on the sides of his face.\n\n He finds an empty seat in the back of the bus. Sees a sad\\-\n eyed FOUR\\-YEAR\\-OLD GIRL, face puffy from crying, sitting on\n her knees looking back at him. Her mother's facing forward,\n but even from behind you can tell she's angry.\n\n Joker sees the sad\\-eyed girl staring straight back at him. He\n doesn't know where to look, feeling self\\-conscious and small.\n He gets back into \"character\" smiling like a clown and covers\n his face with his hands\\-\\- Starts playing the peek\\-a\\-boo game\n with her.\n\n The girl stares back at him for a moment then giggles\\-\\-\n\n WOMAN ON BUS (turns back to Joker;\n already annoyed)\n Can you please stop bothering my\n kid?\n\n JOKER I wasn't bothering her, I was\\-\\-\n\n WOMAN ON BUS (interrupts)\n Just stop.\n\n AND SUDDENLY JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. LOUD. He covers his mouth\n trying to hide it\\-\\- Shakes his head, laughter pausing for a\n moment, but then it comes on stronger. His eyes are sad. It\n actually looks like the laughter causes him pain.\n 8\\.\n\n People on the bus are staring. The girl looks like she's\n going to cry again.\n\n WOMAN ON BUS You think that's funny?\n\n Joker shakes his head no, but he can't stop laughing. He\n reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small card. Hands it to\n the woman.\n\n CLOSE ON THE CARD, it reads: \"Forgive my laughter. I have a\n condition (more on back)\"\n\n She turns the card over and there is a bunch of information\n in small writing\\-\\-\n \"It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughter that\n doesn't match how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain\n neurological conditions.\"\n\n She doesn't read it (but if you freeze frame the movie you\n could). She just shakes her head annoyed and throws the card\n on the ground.\n\n Joker laughs harder. Tears running down his face.\n\n Not wanting to attract any more attention to himself, he\n pulls up his red hood, and uses his threadbare scarf to cover\n his mouth, trying to muffle the laughter.\n\n He looks out at the city passing him by.\n\n\n5 EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE, STREETS \\- GOTHAM \\- EVENING 5\n The bus pulls away, sun almost gone.\n\n Joker heads slowly down the litter\\-covered streets. Garbage\n is piled along the sidewalks, the air thick with smog creates\n a haze over everything.\n\n The streets are crowded with the poor, the elderly and\n disenfranchised. Women with children in busted strollers.\n Homeless people sleeping on subway grates. Stray dogs. His is\n one of the few white faces.\n\n Joker makes his way into a run\\-down drug store, behind him\n two drunks fight on the corner, beating the shit out of each\n other. Joker, and nobody else for that matter, pays them any\n attention.\n\n No one here gives a shit.\n 9\\.\n6 INT. LOBBY, APARTMENT BUILDING \\- EVENING 6\n A shabby lobby in a building that was once probably pretty\n nice, but now it's a dump.\n\n Joker checks his mailbox. He's holding a small white\n (prescription) bag in his hand.\n\n The mailbox is empty.\n\n\n7 INT. ELEVATOR, APARTMENT BUILDING \\- CONTINUOUS 7\n Joker steps onto the wheezing elevator, harsh fluorescent \n lights, graffiti on the walls. As the door closes, he hears\\-\\- \n\n SOPHIE (OS) Wait!!\n\n He puts his foot out with some panache to stop the closing\n door\\-\\- He's a romantic at heart. Ding.\n\n And SOPHIE DUMOND (late 20's), tired eyes, hands filled with\n grocery bags, steps onto the elevator with GIGI, her 5\\-year\\-\n old daughter.\n\n SOPHIE Thank you.\n (realizing)\n Of course it's you,\\-\\- everyone else\n in this building is just so fucking\n rude.\n\n Joker nods \"thanks.\" Holds his breath, hoping he doesn't\n start to laugh.\n\n Floors dinging as the elevator rises.\n\n Joker sees GiGi licking the dirty smudged elevator handrail\n behind her mom.\n\n SOPHIE How's your mom doing?\n\n He takes a deep breath, he's uncomfortable talking to her,\n holds up the white prescription bag.\n\n JOKER It's day to day. I'm doing\n everything I can to get her back on\n her feet.\n (re: pharmacy bag)\n Picked up her medicine. Gonna make\n her some dinner.\n 10\\.\n SOPHIE (smiles; being polite)\n She's lucky she has you\\-\\-\n\n Joker smiles thanks, can't help but glance at GiGi licking\n the rail.\n\n Sophie finally notices. She wants to grab her but can't with\n her hands full. Tries to kick her away\\-\\-\n\n SOPHIE Jesus. Don't do that, GiGi! How\n many times have I told you that?\n (to Joker)\n This building is so awful, isn't\n it?\n\n Joker just nods... he doesn't know what to say, but clearly\n wants to continue this conversation with Sophie.\n\n The doors open. They all step off.\n\n SOPHIE Okay. Well, tell your mom I said\n hello.\n\n And Sophie and GiGi walk down the hall\\-\\- the opposite way of\n Joker. He just stands there for a beat. Heart beating fast.\n\n JOKER (calls out after her)\n Hey Sophie\\-\\-\n\n She turns around.\n\n JOKER I'll tell my mom you said hello.\n\n She smiles as in \"yeah, that's what I said.\"\n\n\n8 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, FRONT DOOR \\- EVENING 8\n Old apartment, worn carpet. Nothing's new inside but it's\n fairly neat and well\\-kept.\n\n Joker closes the door behind him, leans his back against it\n and swoons. Hears a deep purring sound. He looks down and\n sees an OLD ORANGE CAT, rubbing up against his leg.\n\n Then\\-\\-\n 11\\.\n MOM (OS) (shattering the moment,\n calls out)\n Happy?! Did you check the mail\n before you came up?\n\n JOKER Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.\n\n MOM (OS) You sure you looked? Sometimes I\n don't know where your head is.\n\n Joker glances back down and sees the cat is gone.\n\n JOKER Yes I'm sure. And my head's right\n here. I'm gonna make you some\n dinner, okay?\n\n QUICK CUTS:\n JOKER TEARS OPEN THE PRESCRIPTION BAG... A FLURRY OF PILL BOTTLES TUMBLE OUT ONTO THE COUNTER.\n SEE HIS NAME, \"ARTHUR FLECK\" ON THE ORANGE PILL BOTTLES, AND GLIMPSE THE GENERIC DRUG NAMES, TEMAZEPAM... PERPHENAZINE... AHENELZINE... AMITRIPTYLINE... BENZEDRINE... DIAZEPAM... MEPROBAMATE...\n TAKES OUT ONE PILL FROM EACH THE TEMAZEPAM AND MEPROBAMATE BOTTLES.\n TWO PILLS BEING CRUSHED UP TO POWDER.\n SPRINKLES THE POWDER ON TOP OF A TV DINNER.\n SWALLOWS A HANDFUL OF PILLS FROM THE OTHER BOTTLES.\n LOOKS DOWN AND SMILES AT THE ORANGE CAT LOOKING UP AT HIM FROM THE COUNTER.\n9 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT \\- NIGHT 9\n Joker brings the food to his mother, PENNY (70's), lying in\n her bed. The TV is on, playing the local news.\n\n Joker sets the food down in front of his mother. He covers\n the pain from his beating the best he can\\-\\- His mother\n doesn't seem to notice anyway.\n\n MOM He must not be getting my letters.\n 12\\.\n\nJoker sits down on a chair next to the bed.\n\n JOKER He's a busy man.\n\n MOM Too busy for me? I worked for that\n family for 12 years. He always had\n a smile for me. Least he could do\n is write back.\n\n JOKER Ma, eat. You need to eat.\n\n MOM You need to eat. Look how skinny\n you are.\n\nBefore Joker can say anything, his mother points to the news\non the TV\\-\\-\n\n MOM All day long it's more bad news.\n That's all there is.\n\n JOKER Maybe you shouldn't watch so much\n television.\n\n MOM (ignoring)\n He's the only hope for Gotham.\n He'll make a great mayor. Everybody\n says so.\n\n JOKER (playful)\n Everybody who? Who do you talk to?\n\n MOM Well everybody on the news.\n\n JOKER Stop it. He's not even gonna run.\n Why would Thomas Wayne want to be\n mayor? He can do more good as a\n businessman.\n\n MOM Because he cares about this city.\n And everyone in it\\-\\- that's why I\n can't believe he hasn't written me\n back.\n 13\\.\n JOKER He will. Now eat some dinner.\n\nHe feeds her a bite of the food.\n\n JOKER How you feeling today?\n\n MOM I don't know. It always hits me\n worse at night, you notice that?\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n JOKER (teasing)\n Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a\n werewolf?\n\nHE HOWLS SOFTLY like a wolf. She laughs.\n\n MOM It's not funny.\n\nJoker watches her as he cuts up some more of her food.\n\n MOM Anyway, I wrote a new letter today.\n A better one. I want you to hand\n deliver it to him.\n\n JOKER What? Why?\n\n MOM Cause maybe the mailman is throwing\n them away. We should have tipped\n him at Christmas time.\n\n JOKER Who tips their mailman?\n\n MOM Some people do. Rich people do.\n\nJoker sighs, resigned.\n\n JOKER Okay. I can try his office.\n Tomorrow.\n 14\\.\n MOM Thank you.\n (she pats the bed)\n Come sit. It's almost on.\n\n Joker gets into bed with her.\n\n CLOSE ON TELEVISION, intro to \"LIVE WITH MURRAY FRANKLIN!\",\n and we HEAR THE ANNOUNCER over clips of comedy bits, stars\n and Murray Franklin himself\\-\\-\n\n ANNOUNCER (ON TV) It's Live with Murray Franklin!\n Tonight Murray welcomes, Sandra\n Winger, comedian Skip Byron and the\n piano stylings of Yeldon \\& Chantel!\n As always, Don Ellis and his Jazz\n Orchestra. And now, without any\n further ado\\-\\- Murray Franklin!\n\n Joker and his mom watch from bed, this is a ritual of theirs.\n\n\n10 INT. LIVING ROOM, MOM'S APARTMENT \\- NIGHT 10\n Late night. Joker's mom is dead asleep. Joker is alone in the\n living room, which doubles as his bedroom. He can't ever\n sleep. He opens his worn notebook. Flips to a page titled\n \"Jokes\" and starts writing\\-\\-\n\n CLOSE ON WORDS, as he slowly writes: \"The worst part about\n having a mental illness is...\"\n\n ANGLE ON JOKER, pausing, thinking it over for a moment. Then\n he laughs to himself when he comes up with something.\n\n CLOSE ON WORDS, coming faster now, \"...that people still\n expect you to behave as if you don't.\"\n\n CUT TO:\n11 EXT. WAYNE TOWER, STREET \\- MIDTOWN \\- MORNING 11\n Joker's looking up at the intimidating steel and glass tower,\n he looks so small, holding his mom's letter in his hand.\n Bustle of professionals coming in and out of the company's\n corporate headquarters, Joker looks out of place.\n\n He heads inside through the giant glass doors.\n 15\\.\n12 INT. RECEPTION, WAYNE ENTERPRISES \\- 25TH FLOOR \\- MORNING 12\n Joker steps off an elevator and walks up to the white marble\n reception desk as if he belongs there\\-\\-\n\n JOKER Hello. I have a personal letter for\n Mr. Thomas Wayne.\n\n RECEPTIONIST Okay. You can leave it with me.\n\n JOKER It's kind of important. I need to\n make sure he gets it himself.\n\n RECEPTIONIST Oh, in that case, I'll buzz you\n right in.\n\n Joker goes to enter\\-\\-\n\n RECEPTIONIST I'm kidding. Leave it here.\n\n He laughs along with her, even though she's not laughing.\n\n JOKER Oh. Right\\-\\- well, my mom used to\n work for the Wayne family\\-\\- for 12\n years. She was their housekeeper.\n\n A couple other business people are now waiting behind Joker,\n there for meetings.\n\n RECEPTIONIST That's great. But you can leave it\n with me or you can leave with the\n letter. Those are your options. Now\n please step aside.\n\n JOKER Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe\n at least call back to him? Tell him\n that I'm here.\n\n RECEPTIONIST Thomas Wayne is away on business.\n\n Joker is getting frustrated.\n\n JOKER Okay. Well, can I have your name?\n So I know who I left it with.\n 16\\.\n\n Now Joker sees a GROUP OF MEN walking behind the glass that\n separates the reception area from the back offices. Amongst\n the group, he catches a glimpse of THOMAS WAYNE (60's), deep\n tan, hair dyed so black it's almost blue.\n\n JOKER Wait. He's right there.\n (goes up to the glass,\n shouts)\n Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne.\n\n He starts banging on the glass... but the group keeps moving.\n Not noticing him.\n\n RECEPTIONIST Sir. Please stop. Sir!!\n\n Joker keeps banging on the glass.\n\n\n13 EXT. WAYNE TOWER, FRONT ENTRANCE \\- MORNING 13\n The glass doors swing open and Joker is forcibly thrown onto\n the street. TWO LARGE SECURITY GUARDS stand over him.\n\n He is still holding the letter.\n\n He makes as if he's going to leave peacefully, then at the\n last minute, TAKES ANOTHER RUN AT THE DOOR\\-\\-\n\n The two guards stiff arm him.\n\n CUT TO:\n14 INT. HA\\-HA'S TALENT BOOKING, LOCKER ROOM \\- DAY 14\n The cramped locker room of a small talent booking agency.\n This is where Joker works. They \"rent out\" talent for parties\n and events. Clowns, magicians, male strippers.\n\n Joker takes off his shirt, grimaces in pain as he moves. His\n body's bruised from the beating he took chasing after his\n sign.\n\n RANDALL (OS) You okay?\n\n He turns. RANDALL (mid 50's), a big bear of a know\\-it\\-all,\n standing there. He's a party clown as well. He's half\\-dressed\n in his clown suit.\n 17\\.\n RANDALL I heard about the beat down you\n took. Fucking savages.\n\n JOKER It was just a bunch of kids. I\n should have left it alone.\n\nRandall opens his locker\\-\\-\n\n RANDALL It's crazy out there. And it's only\n getting worse.\n\n JOKER (nods)\n My mother says that the people\n nowadays lack empathy.\n\n RANDALL What's empathy?\n\n JOKER It means like \"feeling for other\n people.\"\n\n RANDALL Like sympathy?\n\n JOKER Kind of. But different.\n\nRandall comes over, hands Joker a brown paper bag\\-\\- Joker\nlooks inside. It's a GUN, a .38 snub\\-nose revolver. \n\nJoker looks up at him, confused\\-\\-\n\n RANDALL Take it. I got a few. You gotta\n protect yourself out there, buddy.\n Too many wackos.\n\nAs Joker stares at it\\-\\-\n\n RANDALL (lowers his voice)\n It's a .38 snub\\-nose. Gets the job\n done if you ever need to use it.\n Usually pulling it out is enough.\n\n JOKER I, I don't have the money for this, \n Randall.\n 18\\.\n RANDALL Don't sweat it. You can pay me some\n other time. You're my boy.\n\n That lands with Joker, he smiles to himself.\n\n RANDALL (as he walks away)\n But you didn't get it from me,\n okay?\n\n Joker nods. Puts the brown paper bag in his locker. Slowly \n starts to get dressed\\-\\- his eyes darting toward the bag as he \n does.\n\n Another clown, GARY (30's), a dwarf, pops his head into the\n locker room.\n\n GARY Arthur,\\-\\- Hoyt wants to see you in\n his office.\n\n JOKER What for?\n\n GARY No clue.\n\n\n15 INT. FRONT OFFICE, HA\\-HA'S TALENT BOOKING \\- DAY 15\n Joker still half\\-dressed, walks into the cramped office.\n\n His boss, HOYT VAUGHN (60's) sits behind a metal desk. The\n office is a complete mess, newspapers and files litter the\n desk. A giant ashtray filled with cigarette butts. A calendar\n of booking hangs on the wall. A scribbled, jumbled mess.\n\n JOKER Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to\n see me?\n\n HOYT (without even looking up)\n How's the comedy career? Are you a\n famous stand\\-up yet?\n\n JOKER Not quite. Haven't even performed\n yet. Just been working my material.\n This business is all about fine\\-\n tuning.\n\n Now Hoyt looks up. Takes a drag from his cigarette.\n 19\\.\n HOYT Right.\n\nJoker goes to sit down\\-\\-\n\n HOYT Don't sit. This will be quick.\n\nJoker stops in his tracks.\n\n HOYT Look, I like you, Arthur. A lot of\n the guys here, they think you're a\n freak. But I like you. I don't even\n know why I like you. I mean, you\n don't say much.\n (beat)\n It's probably that stupid laugh. It\n gets me every time. Kills me.\n\nUnsure how to respond, Joker just nods.\n\n HOYT But I got another complaint. And\n it's starting to piss me off.\n\nJoker takes a deep breath, maybe picks at his eyebrow.\n\n HOYT Kenny's Music. Sunday. The guy said\n you disappeared. Never even\n returned his sign.\n\n JOKER No. I got jumped. I told you about\n that.\n\n HOYT For a sign? Bullshit. It makes no\n sense, just give him his sign back.\n He's going out of business for\n god's\\-\\-\n\nBANG! Out of nowhere, Joker slams his head into the wall.\nHead\\-butting it hard.\n\n HOYT (taken aback)\n Hey!\n\nBANG! BANG! He does it two more times. Breaking the plaster\non the wall\\-\\-\n 20\\.\n HOYT What the fuck, Arthur?!\n\n JOKER (voice tightens)\n I don't have his sign. \n\n And Joker just stares at Hoyt, some blood forming on his\n forehead\\-\\- \n\n CUT TO:\n16 EXT. BACK ALLEY, OUTSIDE HA\\-HA'S \\- AMUSEMENT MILE \\- DAY 16\n WE'RE AT THE FAR END OF AN ALLEY, about halfway down, catch a \n glimpse of Joker still half\\-dressed on the other side of a \n dumpster.

I can't explain it to you any\n better than that.\n\n Joker nods. Annoyed, but not worth the argument. He stands up\n to get her a towel.\n\n JOKER I don't want you worrying about\n money.

Not sure what to do, or even\nif he wants to do anything at all.\n\nAND HE JUST BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. He covers his mouth with his\nhand as they continue to harass the woman.\n\nThey all look over\\-\\- What the fuck is this clown laughing at?\n\n WALL STREET \\#1 Something funny, asshole?\n\nWith their attention diverted, the young woman rushes out\nthrough the door between subway cars, glancing back at Joker\nbefore she goes\\-\\-\n\n WALL STREET \\#3 (shouts after her)\n BITCH!\nJoker laughs even harder through his hand.

She waves him over to\n her bed.\n\n MOM They're interviewing him about\n those horrible murders on the\n subway last week.\n 41\\.\n JOKER Why are they talking to him?\n\nHis mother shushes him. Joker sits on the end of the bed next\nto her. It's one of those \"Good Morning, Gotham\" shows.\n\n THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV) \\-\\-as you know, Jerry, all three of\n them worked at Wayne Investments,\n and they were the best of the best.\n Solid young men.\n\nA small smirk registers on Joker's face when photos of the\nTHREE WALL STREET GUYS come up on the screen.\n\n THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV) And while I didn't know them\n personally, like all Wayne\n employees, past and present, they\n were family.\n\nJoker's mom perks up at that\\-\\-\n\n MOM You hear that! I told you. We're\n family.\n\nANGLE ON TELEVISION, footage of GRAFFITI around the city.\n\"KILL THE RICH\" spray painted on a storefront. \"F CK WALL\nSTREET\" written on a subway wall. \"RESIST\" scrawled across a\nbillboard.\n\n \"GOOD MORNING\" HOST (ON TV) There now seems to be a groundswell\n of anti\\-rich sentiment in the city.\n It's almost as if our less\n fortunate residents have taken the\n side of the killer.\n\n THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV) Yes and it's a shame. It's one of\n the reasons I'm considering a run\n for mayor. Gotham has lost its way.\n\n \"GOOD MORNING\" HOST (ON TV) Are you announcing your candidacy?\n\n THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV) (smiles)\n No comment.\n\nWe hear his mother gasp, excited.\n 42\\.\n \"GOOD MORNING\" HOST (ON TV) What about the eyewitness report of\n the suspect being a man in clown\n make\\-up or a clown mask\\-\\- Care to\n comment on that?\n\n Joker leans in, intrigued. The camera zooms in closer to\n Thomas Wayne on the screen...\n\n THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV) It makes total sense to me. What\n kind of coward would do something\n that cold\\-blooded? Someone who\n hides behind a mask. Someone who's\n envious of those more fortunate\n than themselves, yet too scared to\n show their own face.\n (to camera)\n And until that jealousy ends, those\n of us who've made a good life for\n ourselves will always look at those\n who haven't as nothing but clowns.\n\n CUT TO:\n46 INT. COMEDY CLUB, BACKSTAGE HALLWAY \\- NIGHT 46\n JOKER'S POV, slowly walking down the hall \\-\\- as if in slow\n motion \\-\\- toward a curtain at the end, spotlight bleeding\n through, other wannabe comics looking at him as he passes\\-\\-\n\n CLOSE ON JOKER, eyeing the others, sweat beading on his\n forehead\\-\\-\n\n He gets to the curtain, the light, pulls his worn joke\\-\n notebook out of his back pocket. Glancing into the room he\n sees it's a pretty good crowd. Sees Sophie taking a seat in\n the back.\n\n Wheeling back into the dark hallway, he catches his breath in\n the shadows\\-\\-\n\n And starts BANGING HIS HEAD BACK against the wall\\-\\-\n\n He hears the EMCEE from the stage.\n\n EMCEE (OS) This next comic describes himself\n as a lifelong Gotham resident who\n from a young age was always told\n that \"his purpose in life was to\n bring joy and laughter into this\n cold, dark world.\" Ummm. Okay.\n 43\\.\n\n He hears the crowd laugh.\n\n EMCEE (OS) Please help me welcome Arthur\n Fleck!\n\n There is a smattering of applause.\n\n CUT TO:\n JOKER STEPPING ON STAGE, out under the spotlight, lifts the\n microphone in front of his mouth, the light so bright he\n can't see faces in the dark audience, his hand trembling\n holding onto his worn notebook\\-\\-\n\n He takes a deep breath, looks out at the dark crowd, and\n opens his mouth.\n\n And starts to laugh. His eyes go wide. God no, not now. A\n terrified look comes to his face under the laughter. He just\n keeps laughing. The crowd is just staring back at him.\n\n Finally he composes himself\\-\\-\n\n JOKER (trying to stop himself\n from laughing)\n \\-\\- good evening, hello.\n (deep breath; trying to\n stop laughing)\n Good to be here.\n (keeps cracking up)\n I, I hated school as a kid.

COMEDY CLUB, CHINATOWN STREET \\- NIGHT 47\n Joker and Sophie walking out of the club after the show, the\n audience trickles out around them. Nobody looking in Joker's\n direction, nobody says anything to him, maybe one or two even\n cracking up at him behind his back. Garbage bags crowding the \n narrow street, lit up by the bright signs. \n 44\\.\n\nJoker and Sophie walk a ways without saying a word. Awkward\nsilence.\n\nThen\\-\\-\n\n JOKER So, did you laugh? Really couldn't\n see much from up there.\n\nSophie pauses, doesn't know what to say. She lights up a\ncigarette.\n\n SOPHIE (trying to be nice)\n Of course. Yeah. You couldn't hear\n anything?\n\n JOKER All I heard was my heart pounding.\n\n SOPHIE It was good. I really needed to get\n out of my apartment so, thanks.\n (beat)\n What happened to the rest of your\n friends?\n\n JOKER What friends?\n\n SOPHIE Didn't you say some of your friends\n were coming?\n\n JOKER (he forgot; recovers)\n Yeah, I decided not to invite them.\n As a performer sometimes you want\n to see how a \"real\" crowd reacts.\n People who don't already love me,\n or, or have a notion of who I am,\n you know?\n\n SOPHIE (nodding)\n Yeah. I get that.\n\nJoker smiles at the connection. They walk past a newsstand\\-\\-\na wall of Chinese language newspapers mixed with local papers \nand tabloids, screaming headlines about the three Wall Street \nGuys gunned down on the train.\n\nJoker stops and stares at the headlines\\-\\-\n 45\\.\n\nCLOSE ON HEADLINES, \"Subway Vigilante\"... \"Yuppie Slaughter\"\n\"Killer Clown On The Loose?\"...\n\n SOPHIE (OS) (re: the headlines)\n You believe that shit?\n\n JOKER Yeah,\\-\\- I don't know how something\n like that happens.\n\n SOPHIE Please. I'll bet you five bucks\n those rich assholes deserved it.\n\nHe turns to her.\n\n JOKER You think?\n\n SOPHIE Look at their faces. Those smug\n smiles. I've seen that look. Fuck\n them.\n\nSophie flicks her cigarette away and starts walking.\n\n SOPHIE The guy who did it is a hero. Three\n less pricks in Gotham City. Woo\\-\n hoo! Only a million more to go.\n\nJoker watches her walk for a beat.\n\n JOKER (calls out to her)\n Hey. You want to get some coffee?\n\nSophie turns around and smiles. She looks great, even in\nfront of the mounds of garbage bags that line the sidewalk.\n\nAN AMBULANCE SCREAMS BY, SIRENS BLARING as Sophie says\nsomething that Joker doesn't hear. She keeps walking.\n\nJoker chases after her and trips over a TIN GARBAGE CAN LID\\-\\-\n\nCLANG. CLANG. He falls down flat on his face.\n\nSophie turns and bursts out laughing. She can't help but\nlaugh. It's the first time she's laughed all night.\n 46\\.\n48 INT. SZECHUAN ACE RESTAURANT, TABLE \\- NIGHT 48\n Table covered with plates of half\\-eaten Chinese food. \n\n Joker and Sophie sitting across from each other, middle of \n conversation. Crowded room, brightly lit, looks more like a \n casino. Almost everybody eating there is Chinese. It's loud. \n\n SOPHIE \\-\\-I'm telling you, it's across the\n board. Wall Street, the banks,\n politicians. They've been making a\n killing for years. Fuck them.\n\n Joker takes a moment to think about what she said.\n\n JOKER I don't know.\n\n SOPHIE What don't you know?\n\n JOKER Not all of them are awful. Take\n someone like Thomas Wayne for\n example. He's a hero.\n\n SOPHIE Oh c'mon, he's the worst!\n\n Joker is taken aback\\-\\-\n\n JOKER Sophie, he's the only one who can\n save this city.\n\n SOPHIE You can't be serious!? He's a\n complete narcissist. Brags about\n his money. Meanwhile, the rest of\n us can barely make rent. Or feed\n our kids.\n\n Joker nods. Thinking about it.\n\n Then\\-\\-\n\n JOKER What happened?\n\n SOPHIE With what?\n 47\\.\n JOKER With your job. At the bank?\n\n SOPHIE (suddenly uncomfortable)\n Oh. Yeah, I was, um,\\-\\-\n\n JOKER We don't have to talk about it. \n\nBeat. \n\n SOPHIE Have you ever been fired before? \n\nJoker thinks it over for a moment. \n\n JOKER Every time. \n\n SOPHIE And have you ever wanted to torch \n the place? \n\n JOKER (thinks it over again) \n Every time. \n\nSophie smiles. \n\n SOPHIE Right. And this was like the first \n good job I had in like, years. Not \n waitressing or anything like that. \n It was 9\\-5\\. I had benefits. You \n know what that means when you have \n a kid? \n\nJoker just looks at her, he doesn't really know what that \nmeans. He just smiles. \n\n SOPHIE But from the very first day, the \n manager guy starts smiling at me, \n whispering in my ear, touching me, \n trying to get me to sleep with him\\-\\- \n\n JOKER (interrupting) \n Did you do it? Did you go to bed \n with him? \n 48\\.\n SOPHIE Fuck no. The guy's a fucking pig. \n So finally I complained to his \n boss, and they fired me... And now, \n now I don't know what to do with \n myself. \n\n JOKER Right. Wait, what do you mean? \n\n SOPHIE I finally felt good. Like I had a \n future. A purpose. And now I don't \n even know how I'm gonna pay my \n rent. \n\nAND JOKER STARTS LAUGHING. He puts a hand over his mouth\ntrying to cover it, but he can't stop cracking up\\-\\-\n\nIt's unsettling and disturbing for Sophie. People eating, \nwaiters in red vests, busboys, all look over and stare at \nhim. A few laugh. Joker turns away embarrassed, he looks out \nthe plate\\-glass window, face turning red from laughing so\nhard\\-\\-\n\nAS HE LOOKS OUT, HE SEES A GROUP OF ROWDY KIDS walking down\nthe street. One of them glances back before he turns the\ncorner\\-\\- HE'S WEARING A CLOWN MASK THAT LOOKS JUST JOKER'S\nCLOWN FACE. And then he's gone. The group disappears around\nthe corner\\-\\-\n\nJoker can't believe his eyes, still laughing\\-\\- He turns to\nSophie who didn't see them. Just sits there awkwardly waiting\nfor it to stop.\n\nFinally, it subsides\\-\\-\n\n JOKER (catching his breath)\n I'm sorry. I have this thing\\-\\-\n\n SOPHIE I know. \n\nAwkward beat. \n\n SOPHIE How did you get it?\n\n JOKER I don't know. I read you can get it\n from a brain injury or, or a lesion\n in there. My mom said I was born\n this way. Born laughing.\n 49\\.\n SOPHIE Is that why she calls you Happy?\n\n JOKER Kind of. That actually started when\n I was a kid. The other kids made\n fun of me, called me Happy\\-\\- but\n not in a good way. I got so sick of\n it, one day when I was about ten,\n I, I,\\-\\-\n He smiles.\n\n SOPHIE What?\n\n JOKER I took a razor and cut this smile\n onto my face.\n (she's taken aback as he\n points to the scars)\n Sort of like \"You want happy? Here,\n how's this for happy?\"\n\n He looks down, still smiling. She just watches him for a\n beat.\n\n SOPHIE You okay?\n\n JOKER I've been thinking about this night\n my whole life.\n\n They just sit there for a beat. Quiet.\n\n\n49 INT.

Notices\nsomething sticking out of his jacket pocket. He pulls it out.\n\nIt's the envelope he was supposed to deliver to Thomas Wayne.\n\nHe stares at it for a beat. And then\\-\\-\n\nQuietly rips it open, starts to read the letter:\n\nCLOSE ON WORDS, \"Dearest Thomas, I don't know where else to\nturn...\"\n\n\"Need your help...\"\n\n\"You have a son.

She fired me before\n I even knew I was pregnant with\n you.\n (hear her crying now)\n (MORE) 53\\.\n MOM (OS) (CONT'D) And, I never told him or anybody\n because, well, you can imagine what\n people would say about Thomas and\n me, and, and what they would say\n about you.\n\n JOKER (eyes still closed, head\n leaning against the door)\n What would they say, Ma?\n\n MOM (OS) That I was a whore, and Thomas\n Wayne was a fornicator, and that\n you're a little, unwanted bastard.\n\n AND THE BATHROOM DOOR SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN, and Joker falls\n face first into the bathroom\\-\\-\n\n Just missing his mother, crashing down onto the floor\\-\\-\n\n CUT TO:\n51 EXT.

It's a\n powerful anti\\-psychotic. If she was\n taking that regularly and then\n suddenly stopped, the withdrawal\n could have contributed to her\n stroke.

Nausea...\n anxiety... hallucinations.\n\nJoker shakes his head, no.\n 66\\.\n ER RESIDENT Do you know how long she's been\n taking it?\n\n Joker shakes his head no again, leans in closer to the\n resident\\-\\-\n\n JOKER Can you tell me what those symptoms\n are again?\n\n CUT TO:\n63 INT.

Joker can't find Thomas Wayne in the dark\\-\\-\n 71\\.\n\n He moves to the top of the next aisle, pausing to watch more\n of the film. Suddenly somebody bumps into Joker\\-\\-\n\n He looks up and sees it's one of Thomas Wayne's TWO SECURITY\n GUARDS, escorting Thomas Wayne out of the auditorium\\-\\-\n\n Joker turns and watches them lead him out. Behind Joker on\n screen, the Tramp is rescued by the girl before he falls off\n the edge, orchestra swelling\\-\\-\n\n\n69 INT.

HALLWAY, MEN'S ROOM \\- WAYNE HALL \\- SECONDS LATER 70\n Joker's sweeping up the hallway with his head down, hear the\n orchestra playing the melancholy \"Smile\" from the film's\n score.

He walks toward the sink.\n\n THOMAS WAYNE Excuse me?\n\nJoker follows after him.\n\n JOKER My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son.\n (beat)\n I know you didn't know about me,\n and I don't want anything from you.\n Well... maybe a hug.\n\nAnd Joker smiles, it's all very emotional for him. Thomas\nlooks over at him like he's fucking crazy.\n\n THOMAS WAYNE Jesus? You're the guy who came by\n my house yesterday.\n\nJoker nods, relieved he finally broke through.\n\n JOKER Yes. But they wouldn't let me in,\n wouldn't let me see you. So I came\n here.

Joker walks across the living room like he's on\n the show, smiling, waving to the \"audience\"... He mimes\n shaking Murray's hand... Mimes unbuttoning his jacket and\n sits down.

Then Joker nods okay and \n opens his notebook\\-\\- \n 87\\.\n JOKER (reading) \n Knock\\-knock. \n\n His cat still watching him, now at his feet. Joker crosses\n and uncrosses his legs... Looks uncomfortable.\n\n He glances down at his cat. It's as if he can hear the cat\n talking to him.\n\n JOKER (nods; frustrated)\n Yeah, I don't know if I should\n cross or uncross 'em. Both feel\n completely unnatural.\n\n Joker gets up off the couch and walks back across the living \n room. Waves to the \"audience\"... Mimes shaking Murray's\n hand...

He can't reach it.\n\n Joker just shakes his head to himself and gets up to unlock\n the door.\n\n He walks past Gary who's still trembling almost too afraid to\n look up at him.

WGCTV STUDIOS, FRANKLIN THEATER \\- MIDTOWN \\- EVENING 102\n An excited line of ticket holders waiting to get in to \"Live\n with Murray Franklin!\" The poster marquee box near the door\n reads: \"TONIGHT'S GUESTS.

STUDIO 4B, STAGE \\- FRANKLIN THEATER \\- EVENING 104\n Studio audience filing into the studio, being seated in the\n wide bleachers along one wall. Three TV monitors hang from\n the ceiling, facing the audience. Three studio cameras on the\n floor, black cables strewn everywhere.\n\n The set for \"LIVE WITH MURRAY FRANKLIN!\" is dark... but we\n can still make out his desk... guest chairs... Don Ellis and\n his Jazz Orchestra's band stand... big blue curtain.\n\n\n105 INT. HALLWAY, FRANKLIN THEATER \\- EVENING 105\n The host of the show, MURRAY FRANKLIN (60's), usually quick\n with a bemused grin but right now in a sour mood, walks fast\n down the hall toward the drab dressing rooms with his old\\-\n school producer, GENE UFLAND (60's), who's holding the show's\n rundown rolled up in his hand.\n\n GENE UFLAND \\-\\-You gotta see this nut for\n yourself, Murray. I don't think we\n can put him on. With the rioting \n out there. \n 99\\.\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (annoyed)\n Jesus, Gene, I don't have time for\n this. Cindy's been breaking my\n balls all day.\n\n GENE UFLAND She's still mad at you about that\n thing?\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN Three marriages, you'd think I'da\n fuckin' learned something.\n (then)\n What do I gotta see? I already know\n he's a nut. That's why we're\n putting him on, it's a goof.\n\n A young BLONDE INTERN walks by in the opposite direction. She\n nervously smiles to them and keeps walking. Both men turn and\n check out her ass. Murray winks at Gene.\n\n GENE UFLAND (just shakes his head, and\n smiles)\n I'm telling you, you gotta see him,\n Murray. I think it's too risky, the\n show's too big. It's worth too much\n to blow it on this,\\-\\- this freak.\n\n\n106 INT. DRESSING ROOM, FRANKLIN THEATER \\- CONTINUOUS 106\n Joker's sitting on a small couch in the cramped dressing\n room, watching the local news on a TV that's mounted up on\n the wall, live shots from the subway station where Burke shot \n the protestor, footage of the City Hall rally, clashes with \n police. \n\n He's cleaned himself up as best he could... white grease\\-\n paint smeared more evenly over his face, green dyed hair\n slicked back in place. Red lips redone.\n\n Murray and his producer Gene open the dressing room door\n without knocking\\-\\-\n\n Joker gets up off the couch and goes to shake Murray's hand.\n Murray pauses when he sees Joker's face.\n\n JOKER (shakes Murray's hand;\n effusive)\n Murray, I can't believe this is\n real, that I'm really here.\n 100\\.\n GENE UFLAND It's Mr. Franklin kid, show some\n respect.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN Oh shut up, Gene.\n (to Joker)\n Murray is fine. I prefer it in\n fact. Thanks for coming on the\n show.\n\n JOKER Are you kidding? Thank you for the\n opportunity. I've been watching you\n forever. My mother never missed a\n show.\n\nMurray nods not listening, he's heard this before.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN So what's with the face? Are you\n part of the protests?\n\n JOKER No, I don't believe in any of that.\n I don't believe in anything. I just\n thought it would be good for my\n act.\n\n GENE UFLAND (upset) \n Your act? Didn't you hear that a \n kid got killed on the subway and \n two cops who were almost beat to \n death? You didn't hear about the \n dozens of protestors and police \n injured in the riots? \n\nJoker looks like he's about to bust out laughing. All of that \nnews is playing out on the TV above their heads. He takes a \ndeep breath. Swallows the laugh. \n\nBeat.\n\n JOKER No. I hadn't heard.\n\nGene and Murray share a look.\n\n GENE UFLAND \\-\\-the audience is gonna go crazy if\n you put him on. It was okay maybe\n for a bit, but not a whole segment.\n 101\\.\n\nMurray thinks about it for a beat.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN I like it. It's timely. It's edgy.\n It's, it's dangerous. The best\n comedy is all those things put\n together.\n (done)\n We're gonna go with it.\n\nGene rubs his temples, he doesn't like this, but Murray is\nthe boss.\n\n JOKER Thank you Murray.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (flashes his bemused\n smile; condescending)\n Couple rules though,\\-\\- No cussing,\n no off\\-color material, we do a\n clean show, okay? You'll be on\n after Dr. Sally. Someone will come\n and get you. Good?\n\nJoker nods good. Smiles back at Murray.\n\nMurray and Gene turn to go, exchanging smirks with each other\nas they walk out, making light of Joker who we see behind\nthem still standing there.\n\n JOKER Hey Murray,\\-\\- one small thing? When\n you bring me out, can you introduce\n me as \"The Joker\"?\n\nMurray and Gene look back at him\n\n GENE UFLAND What? You don't want to use your\n real name?\n\n JOKER Honestly, I don't even know what my\n real name is.\n\nJoker smiles, the guys can't tell if he's kidding or not.\n\n JOKER Besides, that's what you called me\n on the show, Murray. A joker.\n Remember?\n 102\\.\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (to Gene; trying not to\n crack up)\n Did I?\n\n GENE UFLAND I have no idea.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (turns back to Joker)\n Well, if you say so, kid. Joker it\n is.\n\n Murray starts to laugh at Joker as he closes the dressing\n room door, shutting it right in his face.\n\n CUT TO:\n107 INT. BACKSTAGE, BEHIND CURTAIN \\- STUDIO 4B \\- NIGHT 107\n JOKER'S BACKSTAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE BLUE CURTAIN, trying to\n watch the show through a slim gap. Behind him there's a\n monitor on a cart playing the live feed.\n\n He moves the curtain aside to get a better look\\-\\- Glimpses\n Murray laughing, finishing up talking to noted sex therapist\n DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN (60's).\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (to Dr. Sally)\n You gotta see our next guest for\n yourself. Will you stick around?\n Maybe you can help, I'm pretty sure\n he could use a doctor.\n\n The audience laughs.\n\n DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN Oh. Does he have sexual problems?\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN He looks like he's got a lot of\n problems.\n\n Another big laugh.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (turns, looks into camera)\n It's been a crazy few days here in\n Gotham, and, I think maybe things\n are about to get crazy around here\n too. Don't go anywhere folks. We'll\n be right back.\n 103\\.\n\n APPLAUSE SIGN LIGHTS UP. Everyone claps. Joker keeps watching \n Murray through the slim gap at the end of the curtain. Hears\n the floor director shout, \"And we're out. Back in three.\" \n\n Joker adjusts the waist of his pants under his jacket. Takes \n a deep breath. \n\n\n108 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B \\- NIGHT 108\n Perched one story above the studio. There's a long console\n where the DIRECTOR sits in front of a gooseneck microphone,\n looking over a double\\-bank of monitors.\n\n Sitting next to him are the ASSOCIATE PRODUCER who times the\n show, and the TECHNICAL DIRECTOR who operates the board. The\n monitor showing the live feed is playing a commercial.\n\n ASSOCIATE PRODUCER Back in 30 seconds.\n\n DIRECTOR Okay, cue the clip. We'll come to\n it straight out of break.\n\n ASSOCIATE PRODUCER Five... Four... Three...\n\n DIRECTOR Roll clip. Put up the show graphic.\n\n ON THE SHOW MONITOR, video of Joker's original stand\\-up\n performance comes up with the show's graphic in the lower\n right of the screen.\n\n\n109 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE \\- STUDIO 4B \\- CONTINUOUS 109\n ON THE SET, Murray watches the clip on the monitor above his\n desk, can't help but laugh. Sees the FLOOR DIRECTOR counting\n him down silently with her fingers... Three... Two... points\n to Camera One.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (looking into camera)\n O\\-kay, you may have seen that clip\n of our next guest when we first\n played it two weeks ago. Now before\n he comes out, I just want to say\n that we're all heartbroken here and\n sensitive to what's going on in the\n city tonight. But, this is how he\n wanted to come on the show. So let\n me introduce\\-\\- The Joker.\n 104\\.\n\nBEHIND THE BLUE CURTAIN, Joker gathers himself, ready for his\nmoment. Doesn't hear his introduction or see a STAGEHAND pull\nopen the curtain for him to go out\\-\\-\n\nON SET, THE CURTAIN'S OPEN, Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra\nare playing Joker on. He doesn't come out. Murray looks over\nto the empty space in the curtain.\n\nThe audience laughs.\n\nBEHIND THE CURTAIN, Joker sees the stagehand motioning for\nhim to go out on stage. Joker starts out, pausing when he\ntakes a step into the bright lights. The stagehand doesn't\nsee him stop, and drops the curtain back on Joker before the\naudience can really see his face\\-\\-\n\nTangling Joker up in the curtain.\n\nThe audience keeps laughing thinking it's part of his act.\nThe band keeps playing him on. Joker untangles himself from\nthe curtain and the audience gets a good look at him.\n\nSome continue laughing. A few boo. Most don't know what to\nmake of him.\n\nJoker walks across the stage, forgetting to wave like he\npracticed. He trips over the riser surrounding the set when\nhe goes to shake Murray's hand. Almost falls on him.\n\nMurray tries not to crack up. The audience laughs. Thinks\nit's part of Joker's act.\n\nJoker reaches out to hug Dr. Sally as she goes in for a\nhandshake. Another awkward moment. More laughs.\n\nJoker finally sits down next to Murray. Crosses and uncrosses\nhis legs. Can't get comfortable.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN So, ahhh, thanks for coming on the\n show. But I gotta tell ya, with\n what happened at City Hall today,\n I'm sure many of our viewers here\n in the studio, and at home, might\n find this look of yours in poor\n taste.\n\nJoker's not listening to Murray. He's mesmerized by all the\nlights shining on him... all the eyes on him... he doesn't\nanswer Murray.\n\nNervous laughter from the audience.\n 105\\.\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (tries again)\n Can you tell us why you're dressed\n like this?\n\n AND JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. Not embarrassed of it anymore. He\n goes with it. Giving in to it, enjoying the laughter.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (can't help but smile at\n Joker's laughing)\n Okay. But I'm not sure how any of\n this is funny. A lot of those\n protesters are going with this\n look. City seems to be full of\n clowns these days.\n\n JOKER (just nods, still\n laughing)\n Yeah. Isn't it great?\n\n Joker just keeps cracking up. Audience still isn't sure what\n to make of him. There's some awkward laughter.\n\n\n110 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B \\- CONTINUOUS 110\n Nobody's laughing in the booth.\n\n TECHNICAL DIRECTOR (looks to the director)\n This guy's got nothing.\n\n DIRECTOR (hits the producer's talk\n button; into the mic)\n Gene, what the hell? You wanna kill\n this?\n\n\n111 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE \\- CONTINUOUS 111\n Murray glances over at his producer Gene Ufland, who's\n sitting off\\-camera on a director's chair by a monitor. Gene\n shrugs at him.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (smiles; trying to save\n the interview)\n So when we talked earlier, you\n mentioned that you aren't\n political. That this look isn't a\n political statement.\n 106\\.\n JOKER (between laughs)\n That's right. I'm not political,\n Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying\n to make people laugh.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (beat; smiles)\n How's that goin' for ya? Have you\n been working on any new material?\n Do you want to tell us a joke?\n\nThe audience claps, egging Joker on to tell a joke.\n\nJoker looks over at Murray \\-\\- his laughing fit finally\nsubsiding \\-\\- and reaches into his jacket pocket and\\-\\-\n\nPulls out his worn notebook, catching his breath. Looks\nthrough it to find a new joke.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN You brought a joke book?\n\nThe audience laughs. Joker smiles, opens the page to Bruce\nWayne's photo, pauses for a moment then turns the page. Finds\na joke\\-\\-\n\n JOKER (reading)\n Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN Oh god, a knock\\-knock joke? And you\n need to read it?\n\n JOKER (nods, reads it again)\n I want to get it right. Knock\n knock.\n\nMurray makes a face like, \"Okay, I'll go along with this.\"\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN Who's there?\n\n JOKER (looks up from his\n notebook)\n It's the police, ma'am. Your son\n has been hit by a drunk driver.\n He's dead.\n\nBeat.\n 107\\.\n112 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B \\- CONTINUOUS 112\n The associate producer tries not to laugh, but she can't help\n it. The director looks over at her like she's lost her mind.\n\n DIRECTOR (shakes his head)\n Okay, ready Camera Two. Take Two.\n Ready Three. Three.\n\n ON THE MONITORS, some of the audience cracks up. Joker smiles\n at the response. Murray Franklin shakes his head, smirking at\n the joke despite himself.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON MONITORS) So, Arthur, you told me backstage\n that your\\-\\-\n\n Joker leans over interrupting Murray, whispers something to\n him.\n\n\n113 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE \\- STUDIO 4B \\- CONTINUOUS 113\n Murray nods as Joker whispers.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (bemused smile;\n patronizing)\n Right. Sorry. I mean Joker\\-\\- you\n told me backstage that your\n mother's a big fan of the show,\n that she never misses it.\n\n Joker puts the notebook back in his pocket. Crosses his legs,\n starting to get a bit more comfortable.\n\n JOKER That's right, Murray. But she's\n dead now.\n\n The audience laughs.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (goes along with the\n \"joke\")\n Hold on. Your mother's dead?\n\n JOKER Yeah. She is.\n\n Murray's not sure if this is part of his act.\n 108\\.\n MURRAY FRANKLIN Okay. What about your father? Does\n he watch the show?\n\nLaughter from the crowd.\n\n JOKER I don't know who my father is,\n Murray. Turns out I was adopted and\n sexually assaulted by my mother's\n boyfriend.\n\nA few in the audience groan. A couple even laugh. Still think\nit's just Joker's edgy, off\\-kilter sense of humor.\n\nDon Ellis plays \"wha\\-wha\\-wha\\-whuuuuh\" on his trumpet from the\nband stand.\n\n DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN Ahhhh! No, no,\\-\\- You can not joke\n about that.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (shakes his head;\n irritated)\n Yeah, that's not funny, that's not\n the kind of humor we do on this\n show.\n\nMurray glances over at Gene in the wings. He gives him the\n\"wrap it up\" sign.\n\n JOKER (just keeps going, on a\n roll)\n Sorry. It's been a rough few\n months, Murray. I mean, after my\n mother died, the police came to\n question me at her funeral. Who\n does that?\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (too easy)\n Oh really? Were you a suspect?\n\nThe audience laughs.\n\n JOKER Very funny, Murray. No, they came\n because I killed those three Wall\n Street guys.\n\nBeat.\n 109\\.\n\n Studio audience can't tell if he's joking or not. Murray\n can't either.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (looks at him confused)\n Okay. I'm waiting for the\n punchline.\n\n JOKER There is no punchline. It's not a\n joke.\n\n\n114 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B \\- CONTINUOUS 114\n The director stares at the monitor.\n\n DIRECTOR Did he just confess to killing the\n Wall Street Three?\n\n TECHNICAL DIRECTOR (horrified)\n Yeah. I think he did.\n\n ASSOCIATE PRODUCER (turns to the director,\n nods)\n He definitely did.\n\n DIRECTOR Jesus Christ.\n (hits the camera talk\n button, into mic)\n Camera Three, get in close.\n\n ANGLE ON MONITOR, Camera Three zooming in close on Joker's\n face.\n\n\n115 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE \\- CONTINUOUS 115\n Gene Ufland is now standing up from his chair. Motions for\n Murray to kill the interview. Murray shakes his head to\n himself. This is a big \"get,\" it could be great television.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (turns back to Joker; with\n gravitas)\n You're serious, aren't you? You're\n telling us you killed those three\n boys on the subway. Why should we\n believe you?\n 110\\.\n JOKER (shrugs)\n I got nothing left to lose, Murray.\n Nothing can hurt me anymore. This\n is my fate, it was always my fate.\n My life is nothing but a comedy.\n\n\n116 INT. SOPHIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM \\- CONTINUOUS 116\n Sophie's sitting on her couch watching this interview play\n out on TV. GiGi's asleep next to her. The open envelope and \n the money are lying on the coffee table. No sign of the \n flowers anywhere. \n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV) Let me get this straight, you think\n killing those young men is funny?\n\n JOKER (ON TV) Yeah. But comedy is subjective,\n isn't that what they say? Besides,\n the way I see it, what happened was\n a good thing. All of you, Gotham,\n the system that knows so much, you\n decide, you decide what's right and\n wrong. What's real or what's made\n up. The same way you decide what's\n funny or not.\n\n Sophie edges forward on the couch, can almost see a hint of\n agreement on her face.\n\n\n117 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE \\- STUDIO 4B \\- CONTINUOUS 117\n Back on set, we can tell by the way Murray's now interviewing\n Joker, talking to him slower, more thoughtfully, that he\n thinks this is gonna get him an Emmy... Maybe even a Peabody.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (beat)\n Okay, I think I understand. You did\n it to start a movement, to become a\n symbol.\n\n JOKER C'mon, Murray, do I look like the\n kind of clown who could start a\n movement? I killed those guys \n because they were awful. \n Everybody's awful these days. It's\n enough to make anyone crazy. \n 111\\.\n MURRAY FRANKLIN So that's it, you're crazy. That's\n your defense for killing three\n young men? Because they were mean \n to you? \n\n JOKER No. They couldn't carry a tune to \n save their lives. \n\nSome audible groans from the audience. \n\n JOKER Why is everyone so upset about \n these guys? Because Thomas Wayne \n went and cried about them on TV?\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN You have a problem with Thomas\n Wayne, too?\n\n JOKER Yeah. I do. Everything comes so\n easy for him.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN And what's wrong with that?\n\n JOKER Have you seen what it's like out\n there, Murray? Do you ever actually \n leave the studio? Everybody just \n yells and screams at each other. \n Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody\n thinks what it's like to be the\n other guy. You think men like \n Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever\n think what it's like to be a guy\n like me? To be anybody but\n themselves.\n (shaking his head, voice\n rising)\n They don't. They think we'll all\n just sit there and take it like\n good little boys. That we won't\n werewolf and go wild. Well, this is \n for all of you out there.\n\nJoker \"howls at the moon.\" It's fucking weird.\n 112\\.\n118 INT.

You\n sound like you're making excuses\n for killing three young men. Not\n everybody's awful. \n\n\n119 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE \\- STUDIO 4B \\- CONTINUOUS 119\n Back on set. Joker looks straight at Murray.\n\n JOKER You're awful, Murray.\n\n There is no more laughter. The audience is watching this\n exchange with full attention.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN Me? How am I awful?\n\n JOKER Playing my video, inviting me on \n the show,\\-\\- You just wanted to make \n fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh \n at Frankenstein on a crowded beach, \n isn't it? You're just like the rest \n of them, Murray. Everything comes\n too easy for you.\n\n MURRAY FRANKLIN (on the spot; defensive)\n You don't know the first thing\n about me, pal. Look what happened\n because of what you did, Arthur,\n what it led to. There are riots out\n there. Two policemen are in \n critical condition, someone was \n killed today. \n 113\\.\n\n Joker nods in agreement, yeah, it's because of what he did. \n\n JOKER How about another joke, Murray? \n What do you get when you cross a \n mentally\\-ill loner with a system\n that abandons him and treats him\n like trash?\n\n Murray pauses for a minute, not really listening to Joker,\n suddenly realizing the seriousness of the situation. He\n starts to turn to camera\\-\\-\n\n JOKER (pulls Randall's gun) \n I'll tell you what you get. You get \n what you fucking deserve,\\-\\- \n\n And as Murray Franklin turns back to him, JOKER SHOOTS THE\n SIDE OF MURRAY'S HEAD OFF\\-\\-\n Blood splatters all over the back of the set.

Hear the\n studio audience still screaming, bedlam all around him.\n\n JOKER (ON TV) (looks straight into\n camera; screams Murray's\n signature sign off)\n GOOD NIGHT AND ALWAYS REMEMBER,\\-\\- THAT'S LIFE!\n And as Joker waves goodbye to the home audience, a black \\& \n white \"INDIAN\\-HEAD TEST PATTERN\" cuts off the show\\-\\- \n\n \"PLEASE STAND BY\"\n HERB ALPERT'S \"Spanish Flea\" plays underneath.\n\n Beat.\n 114\\.\n121 INT.

ALLEY, MOVIE THEATER \\- CONTINUOUS 126\n FROM BEHIND, FAMILY IN THE SHADOWS sees the guy's eyes go \n wide behind the mask, pointing his gun, music swelling\\-\\- \n\n PUNK (shouting) \n You still think we're all fucking \n clowns? \n\n And the punk shoots the man. Reaches out and grabs something \n off the woman's neck before he shoots her as well. Both fall \n to the ground dead. Revealing their young son standing behind \n them\\-\\- \n\n CLOSE ON EIGHT\\-YEAR\\-OLD BRUCE WAYNE, closing his eyes as \n blood sprays across his face. He opens his eyes and looks up \n scared at the man in the \"Joker\" mask who killed his parents, \n Thomas and Martha Wayne. \"Send in the Clowns\" ends. \n\n CUT TO BLACK.\n A long beat. \n\n HEAR LAUGHTER.\n The sound of a man totally cracking up. \n\n FADE IN:\n127 INT. ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL, INTERVIEW ROOM \\- MORNING 127\n CLOSE ON JOKER, tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. He's \n enjoying it, not trying to get it under control. \n 117\\.\n\nHis head's been shaved. He looks medicated or maybe even \nlobotomized. Wearing white institutional clothes. \n\nHIS NEW SMILE IS ALL STITCHED UP, cut deep up the corners of \nhis mouth. Forming a longer, \"happier\" smile. \n\nHe's sitting across from an overworked HOSPITAL DOCTOR \n(50's), African American woman. Somehow it's the exact same \nroom Joker imagined his mother was in some 30 years ago. The \nroom and the doctor also look vaguely similar to the social \nworker and her office in the opening scene. \n\nThe doctor just sits there, waiting for him to stop laughing. \nA weathered notebook is on the table in front of him. \nFinally, Joker stops himself. \n\n HOSPITAL DOCTOR What's so funny? \n\nHe takes a deep breath, his eyes are glazed over. His voice \nis scratchy, like he doesn't use it much. \n\n JOKER \\-\\- just thinking of this joke. \n\n HOSPITAL DOCTOR Do you want to tell it to me? \n\nBeat. \n\n JOKER No. \n\n HOSPITAL DOCTOR Because you don't think I'll get \n it? \n\n JOKER Because it's personal, it's between \n me and him. \n\nBeat. \n\n HOSPITAL DOCTOR Okay. Is the medication working? \n How's your sleeping? \n\n JOKER (nods yes) \n ...\n HOSPITAL DOCTOR How are you feeling? \n 118\\.\n JOKER Good. Everything's good now. \n\n HOSPITAL DOCTOR Have you been writing in your \n journal? \n\n Joker slowly nods. \n\n HOSPITAL DOCTOR Great. I want to make sure you're \n keeping up with it. \n\n JOKER (beat) \n Yeah. \n\n HOSPITAL DOCTOR Have you written about your \n episode? About what happened? \n\n JOKER How I remember it. \n\n HOSPITAL DOCTOR (re: the journal) \n Can I see? \n\n Joker slides his journal across to her. She picks it up and \n flips through the pages\\-\\- \n\n ANGLE ON JOURNAL, blank page after blank page, there's \n nothing inside of it. \n\n The doctor looks up at him confused. \n\n ANGLE ON JOKER, a smile creeping across his face. And we HEAR \n the groovy organ opening to FRANK SINATRA's anthem \"That's \n Life\"... \n\n Beat. \n\n\n128 INT. HALLWAY, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL \\- MORNING 128\n From behind, see Joker shuffling down the hallway past all \n the other mental patients, an orderly by his side. Sinatra \n starts singing. \n\n And Joker does a slide step to the music like he can hear it \n too... into a skip... and another slide step into a spin... \n Dancing down the hallway into the sunset... \n\n IRIS OUT: 119\\.\n\n\"That's Life\" keeps playing over credits.
